# Insert an Element at Its Bottom in a Given Stack

## Problem Statement

You are given a stack `S` and an integer `X`. Your task is to insert `X` at the **bottom** of the given stack.

### Example 1:
#### **Input:**
```
S = [1, 2, 3, 4]
X = 5
```
#### **Output:**
```
[5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```
---
### Example 2:
#### **Input:**
```
S = []
X = 10
```
#### **Output:**
```
[10]
```
---
## **Constraints:**
- `0 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^3`
- `-10^9 ≤ X ≤ 10^9`
  
## **Expected Time Complexity:**
- **O(N)**, where `N` is the size of the stack.

## **Expected Space Complexity:**
- **O(N)** (Recursive Stack Space)
