### Problem Statement

You are given a stack with `N` integers. Your task is to reverse the stack using **recursion**. You are not allowed to use any extra stack or any loop constructs such as `while`, `for`, etc.

### Input Format
- The first line contains an integer `N`, the number of elements in the stack.
- The second line contains `N` space-separated integers representing the elements of the stack (top to bottom order).

### Output Format
- Print the reversed stack in a single line, space-separated, from top to bottom.

### Constraints
- `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^3`
- `-10^9 ≤ stack[i] ≤ 10^9`

### Example 1
**Input:**
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Output:**
```
5 4 3 2 1
```

### Example 2
**Input:**
```
3
10 20 30
```

**Output:**
```
30 20 10
```

**Note:** The solution must be implemented using recursion, and no loops or extra stacks should be used.
