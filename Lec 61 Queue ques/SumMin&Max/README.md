# [**Sum of minimum and maximum elements of all subarrays of size k**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sum-minimum-maximum-elements-subarrays-size-k/)

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers and a number `k`, find the sum of the minimum and maximum elements of all subarrays of size `k`.

---

## Input

- An array `arr` of integers.
- An integer `k` representing the size of the subarrays.

## Output

- An integer representing the total sum of minimum and maximum elements of all subarrays of size `k`.

---

## Questions to Consider

- How would you efficiently find the minimum and maximum elements in each subarray of size `k`?
- What data structures can be used to optimize the process and avoid traversing each subarray fully every time?
- How would sliding window techniques help in solving this problem?
- What would be the time complexity of a naive solution versus an optimized solution?
- How can you manage multiple elements with the same value while maintaining their indices?
- How would you update the window when moving from one subarray to the next?

> **Note:** Focus on optimizing both time and space complexity. Aim to solve it better than the naive O(n\*k) approach.
