## 📘 Problem Description

You are given a generic tree and need to count and return the number of leaf nodes present in it.

A **leaf node** is a node that has no children.

---

## 🧾 Input Format

* The first line contains the data of the root node.
* Subsequent lines contain the number of children for each node followed by the data of each child.

---

## 📤 Output Format

* Print the number of leaf nodes in the tree.

---

## 🧪 Sample Input

```
10 3 20 30 40 2 40 50 0 0 0
```

### Sample Output

```
3
```

---

## 📌 Constraints

* 1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁴ (Number of nodes)
* Each node contains unique integer data.

---

## 💡 Approach Overview

* Traverse the tree using recursion.
* If a node has no children, it is considered a leaf.
* Recursively count all such nodes to determine the total number of leaf nodes.

## 📝 Notes

This problem is ideal for practicing recursive tree traversal. Understanding how to identify and count leaf nodes is fundamental when working with generic trees and lays a strong foundation for more complex tree operations.
